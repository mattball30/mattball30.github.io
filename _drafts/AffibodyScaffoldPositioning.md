My Masters research project investigated developing new computational methods to determine possible binding geometries of small rigid affinity proteins, called Affibodies.

This work was carried out in the [Sormanni Lab](https://www-sormanni.ch.cam.ac.uk/), alongside a PhD student. Once the adjacent project is complete, further information will be added to this page.
