Hello, I'm Matt!

I am a second year PhD fellow as part of the [AiChemist](https://aichemist.eu) MSCA DN Horizon Europe Project, where I am jointly part of the [MolecularAI](https://github.com/molecularai) team at **AstraZeneca** and the Cheminformatics group at the **University of Strasbourg**.

My research interests lie in computational chemical reaction optimisation, specifically the prediction of optimal reaction conditions using artificial intelligence tools.

Prior to this, I completed my Undergraduate and Master's Degrees at the **University of Cambridge**, specialising in Chemistry. I completed my Master's project in the [Sormanni Lab](https://www-sormanni.ch.cam.ac.uk), focusing on rigid-body protein docking.

Outside of my research I love to enjoy the outdoors: playing football, tennis, running and hiking!
