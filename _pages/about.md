Hello, and welcome to my personal website! 

I am entering my first year as a PhD student as part of the AiChemist MSCA DN Horizon Europe Project, with which I am about to begin studying at the University of Strasbourg for 18 months, before moving onto the MolecularAI divsion at AstraZeneca. 

My research interests lie in computational chemical reaction optimisation, specifically the prediction of optimal reaction conditions using artificial intelligence tools.

Outside of my research I love to enjoy the outdoors: walking, running, playing tennis and football!
